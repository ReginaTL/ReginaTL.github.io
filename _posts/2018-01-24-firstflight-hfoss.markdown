## Hello!

Wooo! Website exists, very exciting. This site is built on Jekyll using the Merlot theme and is hosted on GitHub Pages. For the sake of posterity some advice on setting up a jekyll site (talking to you future me who has forgotten things work!). Once you get it [installed on your OS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and have your [GitHub Pages repo setup](https://pages.github.com/), then you probably want to pick a theme. If you go to your settings for the pages repo you will find a nifty option for themes, that include previews. If you want to change the theme and see it locally then change the theme section in your _config.yaml file to the theme name your using. Then if you look in your Gemfile you will find helpful comments that explain you uncomment the gem "github-pages" line and comment out the jekyll gem. If you don't comment out the jekyll gem it will yell at you, as I found out the hard way by not reading fully.

## Firstflight

As for the other things in the [Firstflight assignment](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/firstflight); I use Matrix now to connect to the IRC channels I'm in including #rit, #rit-foss, and #ritlug. If you too want to get setup with Matrix I suggest using [Justin Flory's tutorial](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC) as that's how I got setup. My username there is gen1e. I'm already on the HFOSS mailing list and I have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/reginatl). I've also [just forked the HFOSS repo](https://github.com/ReginaTL/hfoss).
