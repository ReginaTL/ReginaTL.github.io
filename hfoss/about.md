Hi! I'm Regina Locicero, or "Genie" most of the time. I'm a 3rd year Web and Mobile Computing student at RIT. I'm a developer that specializes in android mobile development but I also do Fullstack as well. I really like open source and tabletop RPGs. Currently I'm taking Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software course (or HFOSS) and this is the blog for that course.
